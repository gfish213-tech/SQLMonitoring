# Version History

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-05

Initial release.

### Added
- Express/TypeScript API server connecting to SQL Server via the `mssql`
  package, with in-memory connection pool management (test / connect /
  status / disconnect).
- DMV-backed monitoring endpoints:
  - Server overview (CPU count, active session/request counts, blocked
    request count, buffer cache hit ratio, page life expectancy, batch
    requests/sec)
  - Top queries by CPU time, duration, logical reads, logical writes, or
    execution count (`sys.dm_exec_query_stats`)
  - Active sessions with live command/query text
  - Blocking chains (blocked session → blocker, wait resource)
  - Top wait types from `sys.dm_os_wait_stats`, filtered to exclude benign
    background waits
- React/Vite/TypeScript dashboard with a connection form and auto-polling
  panels for each of the above.
- README and setup instructions.
